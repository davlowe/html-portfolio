<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a computer science senior at Kennesaw State Univeristy in Marietta, Georgia, graduating in the fall of 2024. 
   I currently work part-time in a warehouse, where I have learned the importance of teamwork as well as building
   strong relationships with my coworkers and mentors.</p>

<p>Outside of school and work, I enjoy learning new languages (both programming
  and natural), spending time with family, doing background (extra) work in TV shows and movies,
  and watching tv shows and movies.
